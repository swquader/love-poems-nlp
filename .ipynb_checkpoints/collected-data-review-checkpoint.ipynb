How soon the night overtakes us!+In the old country the twilight is longer; but here in the forest+Suddenly comes the dark, with hardly a pause in its coming,+Hardly a moment between the two lights, the day and the lamplight;+Yet how grand is the winter! How spotless the snow is, and perfect!”+\\n+Thus spake Elizabeth Haddon at nightfall to Hannah the housemaid,+As in the farm-house kitchen, that served for kitchen and parlor,+By the window she sat with her work, and looked on a landscape+White as the great white sheet that Peter saw in his vision,+By the four corners let down and descending out of the heavens.+Covered with snow were the forests of pine, and the fields and the meadows.+Nothing was dark but the sky, and the distant Delaware flowing+Down from its native hills, a peaceful and bountiful river.+\\n+Then with a smile on her lips made answer Hannah the housemaid:+“Beautiful winter! yea, the winter is beautiful, surely,+If one could only walk like a fly with one’s feet on the ceiling.+But the great Delaware River is not like the Thames, as we saw it+Out of our upper windows in Rotherhithe Street in the Borough,+Crowded with masts and sails of vessels coming and going;+Here there is nothing but pines, with patches of snow on their branches.+There is snow in the air, and see! it is falling already;+All the roads will be blocked, and I pity Joseph to-morrow,+Breaking his way through the drifts, with his sled and oxen; and then, too,+How in all the world shall we get to Meeting on First-Day?”+\\n+But Elizabeth checked her, and answered, mildly reproving:+“Surely the Lord will provide; for unto the snow he sayeth,+Be thou on the earth, the good Lord sayeth; He is it+Giveth snow like wool, like ashes scatters the hoar-frost.”+So she folded her work and laid it away in her basket.+\\n+Meanwhile Hannah the housemaid had closed and fastened the shutters,+Spread the cloth, and lighted the lamp on the table, and placed there+Plates and cups from the dresser, the brown rye loaf, and the butter+Fresh from the dairy, and then, protecting her hand with a holder,+Took from the crane in the chimney the steaming and simmering kettle,+Poised it aloft in the air, and filled up the earthen teapot,+Made in Delft, and adorned with quaint and wonderful figures.+\\n+Then Elizabeth said, ”Lo! Joseph is long on his errand.+I have sent him away with a hamper of food and of clothing+For the poor in the village. A good lad and cheerful is Joseph;+In the right place is his heart, and his hand is ready and willing.”+\\n+Thus in praise of her servant she spake, and Hannah the housemaid+Laughed with her eyes, as she listened, but governed her tongue, and was silent,+While her mistress went on: ”The house is far from the village;+We should be lonely here, were it not for Friends that in passing+Sometimes tarry o’ernight, and make us glad by their coming.”+\\n+Thereupon answered Hannah the housemaid, the thrifty, the frugal:+“Yea, they come and they tarry, as if thy house were a tavern;+Open to all are its doors, and they come and go like the pigeons+In and out of the holes of the pigeon-house over the hayloft,+Cooing and smoothing their feathers and basking themselves in the sunshine.”+\\n+But in meekness of spirit, and calmly, Elizabeth answered:+“All I have is the Lord’s, not mine to give or withhold it;+I but distribute his gifts to the poor, and to those of his people+Who in journeyings often surrender their lives to his service.+His, not mine, are the gifts, and only so far can I make them+Mine, as in giving I add my heart to whatever is given.+Therefore my excellent father first built this house in the clearing;+Though he came not himself, I came; for the Lord was my guidance,+Leading me here for this service. We must not grudge, then, to others+Ever the cup of cold water, or crumbs that fall from our table.”+\\n+Thus rebuked, for a season was silent the penitent housemaid;+And Elizabeth said in tones even sweeter and softer:+“Dost thou remember, Hannah, the great May-Meeting in London,+When I was still a child, how we sat in the silent assembly,+Waiting upon the Lord in patient and passive submission?+No one spake, till at length a young man, a stranger, John Estaugh,+Moved by the Spirit, rose, as if he were John the Apostle,+Speaking such words of power that they bowed our hearts, as a strong wind+Bends the grass of the fields, or grain that is ripe for the sickle.+Thoughts of him to-day have been oft borne inward upon me,+Wherefore I do not know; but strong is the feeling within me+That once more I shall see a face I have never forgotten.”+\\n+II+\\n+E’en as she spake they heard the musical jangle of sleigh-bells,+First far off, with a dreamy sound and faint in the distance,+Then growing nearer and louder, and turning into the farmyard,+Till it stopped at the door, with sudden creaking of runners.+Then there were voices heard as of two men talking together,+And to herself, as she listened, upbraiding said Hannah the housemaid,+“It is Joseph come back, and I wonder what stranger is with him?”+\\n+Down from its nail she took and lighted the great tin lantern+Pierced with holes, and round, and roofed like the top of a lighthouse,+And went forth to receive the coming guest at the doorway,+Casting into the dark a network of glimmer and shadow+Over the falling snow, the yellow sleigh, and the horses,+And the forms of men, snow-covered, looming gigantic.+Then giving Joseph the lantern, she entered the house with the stranger.+Youthful he was and tall, and his cheeks aglow with the night air;+And as he entered, Elizabeth rose, and, going to meet him,+As if an unseen power had announced and preceded his presence,+And he had come as one whose coming had long been expected,+Quietly gave him her hand, and said, ”Thou art welcome, John Estaugh.”+And the stranger replied, with staid and quiet behavior,+“Dost thou remember me still, Elizabeth? After so many+Years have passed, it seemeth a wonderful thing that I find thee.+Surely the hand of the Lord conducted me here to thy threshold.+For as I journeyed along, and pondered alone and in silence+On his ways, that are past finding out, I saw in the snow-mist,+Seemingly weary with travel, a wayfarer, who by the wayside+Paused and waited. Forthwith I remembered Queen Candace’s eunuch,+How on the way that goes down from Jerusalem unto Gaza,+Reading Esaias the Prophet, he journeyed, and spake unto Philip,+Praying him to come up and sit in his chariot with him.+So I greeted the man, and he mounted the sledge beside me,+And as we talked on the way he told me of thee and thy homestead,+How, being led by the light of the Spirit, that never deceiveth,+\\nFull of zeal for the work of the Lord, thou hadst come to this country.+And I remembered thy name, and thy father and mother in England,+And on my journey have stopped to see thee, Elizabeth Haddon.+Wishing to strengthen thy hand in the labors of love thou art doing.”+\\n+And Elizabeth answered with confident voice, and serenely+Looking into his face with her innocent eyes as she answered,+“Surely the hand of the Lord is in it; his Spirit hath led thee+Out of the darkness and storm to the light and peace of my fireside.”+\\n+Then, with stamping of feet, the door was opened, and Joseph+Entered, bearing the lantern, and, carefully blowing the light out,+Hung it up on its nail, and all sat down to their supper;+For underneath that roof was no distinction of persons,+But one family only, one heart, one hearth and one household.+\\n+When the supper was ended they drew their chairs to the fireplace,+Spacious, open-hearted, profuse of flame and of firewood,+Lord of forests unfelled, and not a gleaner of fagots,+Spreading its arms to embrace with inexhaustible bounty+All who fled from the cold, exultant, laughing at winter!+Only Hannah the housemaid was busy in clearing the table,+Coming and going, and hustling about in closet and chamber.+\\n+Then Elizabeth told her story again to John Estaugh,+Going far back to the past, to the early days of her childhood;+How she had waited and watched, in all her doubts and besetments+Comforted with the extendings and holy, sweet inflowings+Of the spirit of love, till the voice imperative sounded,+And she obeyed the voice, and cast in her lot with her people+Here in the desert land, and God would provide for the issue.+\\n+Meanwhile Joseph sat with folded hands, and demurely+Listened, or seemed to listen, and in the silence that followed+Nothing was heard for a while but the step of Hannah the housemaid+Walking the floor overhead, and setting the chambers in order.+And Elizabeth said, with a smile of compassion, ”The maiden+Hath a light heart in her breast, but her feet are heavy and awkward.”+Inwardly Joseph laughed, but governed his tongue, and was silent.+\\n+Then came the hour of sleep, death’s counterfeit, nightly rehearsal+Of the great Silent Assembly, the Meeting of shadows, where no man +Speaketh, but all are still, and the peace and rest are unbroken!+Silently over that house the blessing of slumber descended.+But when the morning dawned, and the sun uprose in his splendor,+Breaking his way through clouds that encumbered his path in the heavens,+Joseph was seen with his sled and oxen breaking a pathway+Through the drifts of snow; the horses already were harnessed,+And John Estaugh was standing and taking leave at the threshold,+Saying that he should return at the Meeting in May; while above+them Hannah the housemaid, the homely, was looking out of the attic,+Laughing aloud at Joseph, then suddenly closing the casement,+As the bird in a cuckoo-clock peeps out of its window,+Then disappears again, and closes the shutter behind it.+\\n+III+\\n+Now was the winter gone, and the snow; and Robin the Redbreast+Boasted on bush and tree it was he, it was he and no other+That had covered with leaves the Babes in the Wood, and blithely+All the birds sang with him, and little cared for his boasting,+Or for his Babes in the Wood, or the Cruel Uncle, and only+Sang for the mates they had chosen, and cared for the nests they were building.+With them, but more sedately and meekly, Elizabeth Haddon+Sang in her inmost heart, but her lips were silent and songless.+Thus came the lovely spring with a rush of blossoms and music,+Flooding the earth with flowers, and the air with melodies vernal.+\\n+Then it came to pass, one pleasant morning, that slowly+Up the road there came a cavalcade, as of pilgrims+Men and women, wending their way to the Quarterly Meeting+In the neighboring town; and with them came riding John Estaugh.+At Elizabeth’s door they stopped to rest, and alighting+Tasted the currant wine, and the bread of rye, and the honey+Brought from the hives, that stood by the sunny wall of the garden;+Then remounted their horses, refreshed, and continued their journey,+And Elizabeth with them, and Joseph, and Hannah the housemaid.+But, as they started, Elizabeth lingered a little, and leaning+Over her horse’s neck, in a whisper said to John Estaugh+“Tarry awhile behind, for I have something to tell thee,+Not to be spoken lightly, nor in the presence of others;+Them it concerneth not, only thee and me it concerneth.”+And they rode slowly along through the woods, conversing together.+It was a pleasure to breathe the fragrant air of the forest;+It was a pleasure to live on that bright and happy May morning!+\\n+Then Elizabeth said, though still with a certain reluctance,+As if impelled to reveal a secret she fain would have guarded:+“I will no longer conceal what is laid upon me to tell thee;+I have received from the Lord a charge to love thee, John Estaugh.”+\\n+And John Estaugh made answer, surprised by the words she had spoken,+“Pleasant to me are thy converse, thy ways, thy meekness of spirit;+Pleasant thy frankness of speech, and thy soul’s immaculate whiteness,+Love without dissimulation, a holy and inward adorning.+But I have yet no light to lead me, no voice to direct me.+When the Lord’s work is done, and the toil and the labor completed+He hath appointed to me, I will gather into the stillness+Of my own heart awhile, and listen and wait for his guidance.”+\\n+Then Elizabeth said, not troubled nor wounded in spirit,+“So is it best, John Estaugh. We will not speak of it further.+It hath been laid upon me to tell thee this, for to-morrow+Thou art going away, across the sea, and I know not+When I shall see thee more; but if the Lord hath decreed it,+Thou wilt return again to seek me here and to find me.”+And they rode onward in silence, and entered the town with the others.+\\n+IV+\\n+Ships that pass in the night, and speak each other in passing,+Only a signal shown and a distant voice in the darkness;+So on the ocean of life we pass and speak one another,+Only a look and a voice, then darkness again and a silence.+\\n+Now went on as of old the quiet life of the homestead.+Patient and unrepining Elizabeth labored, in all things+Mindful not of herself, but bearing the burdens of others,+Always thoughtful and kind and untroubled; and Hannah the housemaid+Diligent early and late, and rosy with washing and scouring,+Still as of old disparaged the eminent merits of Joseph,+And was at times reproved for her light and frothy behavior,+For her shy looks, and her careless words, and her evil surmisings,+Being pressed down somewhat like a cart with sheaves overladen,+As she would sometimes say to Joseph, quoting the Scriptures.+\\n+Meanwhile John Estaugh departed across the sea, and departing+Carried hid in his heart a secret sacred and precious,+Filling its chambers with fragrance, and seeming to him in its sweetness+Mary’s ointment of spikenard, that filled all the house with its odor.+O lost days of delight, that are wasted in doubting and waiting!+O lost hours and days in which we might have been happy!+But the light shone at last, and guided his wavering footsteps,+And at last came the voice, imperative, questionless, certain.+\\n+Then John Estaugh came back o’er the sea for the gift that was offered,+Better than houses and lands, the gift of a woman’s affection.+And on the First-Day that followed, he rose in the Silent Assembly,+Holding in his strong hand a hand that trembled a little,+Promising to be kind and true and faithful in all things.+Such were the marriage rites of John and Elizabeth Estaugh.+\\n+And not otherwise Joseph, the honest, the diligent servant,+Sped in his bashful wooing with homely Hannah the housemaid;+For when he asked her the question, she answered, ”Nay”; and then added+“But thee may make believe, and see what will come of it, Joseph.”+\\n')\n",

This is the last of it.+What I think he will do, is let things smash.+He’ll sort of swear the time away.

I’m not blaming him.+Take it year in, year out, he doesn’t make much.+We came here for a home for me, you know,+Estelle to do the housework for the board+Of both of us. But look how it turns out:+She seems to have the housework, and besides,+Half of the outdoor work, though as for that,+He’d say she does it more because she likes it.+You see our pretty things are all outdoors.+Our hens and cows and pigs are always better+Than folks like us have any business with.+Farmers around twice as well off as we+Haven’t as good.

You ought to see us+Moving a flock of hens from place to place.+We’re not allowed to take them upside down,+All we can hold together by the legs.+Two at a time’s the rule, one on each arm,+No matter how far and how many times+We have to go.”+“You mean that’s John’s idea.”+“And we live up to it; or I don’t know+What childishness he wouldn’t give way to.+He manages to keep the upper hand+On his own farm. He’s boss. But as to hens:+We fence our flowers in and the hens range.+Nothing’s too good for them. We say it pays.+John likes to tell the offers he has had,+Twenty for this cock, twenty-five for that.+He never takes the money. If they’re worth+That much to sell, they’re worth as much to keep.+Bless you, it’s all expense, though. Reach me down+The little tin box on the cupboard shelf,+The upper shelf, the tin box. That’s the one.+I’ll show you. Here you are.”+“What’s this?”+“A bill—+For fifty dollars for one Langshang cock—+Receipted. And the cock is in the yard.”+“Not in a glass case, then?”+“He’d need a tall one:+He can eat off a barrel from the ground.+He’s been in a glass case, as you may say,+The Crystal Palace, London. He’s imported.+John bought him, and we paid the bill with beads—+Wampum, I call it. Mind, we don’t complain.+But you see, don’t you, we take care of him.”+“And like it, too. It makes it all the worse.”+“It seems as if. And that’s not all: he’s helpless+In ways that I can hardly tell you of.+Sometimes he gets possessed to keep accounts+To see where all the money goes so fast.+You know how men will be ridiculous.+But it’s just fun the way he gets bedeviled—+If he’s untidy now, what will he be——?+“It makes it all the worse. You must be blind.”+“Estelle’s the one. You needn’t talk to me.”+“Can’t you and I get to the root of it?+What’s the real trouble? What will satisfy her?”+“It’s as I say: she’s turned from him, that’s all.”+“But why, when she’s well off? Is it the neighbours,+Being cut off from friends?”+“We have our friends.+That isn’t it. Folks aren’t afraid of us.”+“She’s let it worry her. You stood the strain,+And you’re her mother.”+“But I didn’t always.+I didn’t relish it along at first.+But I got wonted to it. And besides—+John said I was too old to have grandchildren.+But what’s the use of talking when it’s done?+She won’t come back—it’s worse than that—she can’t.”+“Why do you speak like that? What do you know?+What do you mean?—she’s done harm to herself?”+“I mean she’s married—married someone else.”+“Oho, oho!”+“You don’t believe me.”+“Yes, I do,+Only too well. I knew there must be something!+So that was what was back. She’s bad, that’s all!”+“Bad to get married when she had the chance?”+“Nonsense! See what’s she done!

You may have the job.”+“You needn’t think you’re going to get away.+John’s almost here. I’ve had my eye on someone+Coming down Ryan’s Hill. I thought ’twas him.+Here he is now. This box! Put it away.+And this bill.”+“What’s the hurry? He’ll unhitch.”+“No, he won’t, either. He’ll just drop the reins+And turn Doll out to pasture, rig and all.+She won’t get far before the wheels hang up+On something—there’s no harm.

Law enforcement officials everywhere now had a duty to arrest anyone suspected of being a runaway slave on no more evidence than a claimant’s sworn testimony of ownership. The suspected slave could not ask for a jury trial or testify on his or her own behalf. In addition, any person aiding a runaway slave by providing food or shelter was subject to six months’ imprisonment and a $1,000 fine. Officers who captured a fugitive slave were entitled to a bonus. Slave owners only needed to supply an affidavit to a federal marshal to capture an escaped slave. This law led to many free blacks being conscripted into slavery, as they had no rights in court and could not defend themselves against accusations. James Hamlet was the first fugitive arrested under the new law. His African American and Abolitionist friends raised the money necessary to purchase his freedom.+\\n')\n",
